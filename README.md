# Linear_Regression_Bike_Sharing_Assignment
The purpose of this project is to identify the relationship between the independant variables and dependant variable(i.e the sale of sharing bikes). My job is to identify the linear relationship with variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes through linear regression and help the company to be ready for the demand.
